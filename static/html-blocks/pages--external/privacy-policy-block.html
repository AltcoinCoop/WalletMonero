          <li>Introduction</li>
          <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by walletMonero ("we" or "us"). This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Service and any other documents referred to therein or herein) applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications, hosted Monero accounts and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.</p>
          <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice such as by adding a statement to on our blog or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>
          <li>Collection of Information</li>
          <p>Information You Provide to Us - We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, complete a Monero transaction via the Services, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, Monero address, OpenAlias aliases, password, mobile phone number, mobile PIN code and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
          <p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services - When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Log Information: We may log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.</p></li>
            <li><p>Device Information: We may collect information about the mobile device you use to access our mobile application, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.</p></li>
            <li><p>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. Please note that disabling cookies will break the session functionality that is required by the hosted Monero account service.</p></li>
            <li><p>Account Address Information: When you create an account through our Services, a view key is automatically generated and stored via our Services. We do not ever store or know your private spend key, which means that it is cryptographically impossible for us to spend funds on your behalf.</p></li>
            <li><p>Information We Collect From Other Sources: We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For instance, as and when we implement a live chat support system we may collect information provided by you during the use of this system, such as your name and email address. We may also use third-party services branded as walletMonero. Any third-party services may collect information as determined by their own privacy policies.</p></li>
